### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a long time computer person, seasoned full-stack developer and currently an independent contractor.

Previously, I've:
 - Created large-scale (globally used) e-commerce software at INGKA (IKEA)
 - Developed a deep learning platform in a little startup now owned by King/Microsoft
 - Led the development of an innovative (and really niche) digital property-tech platform, in an even smaller company!

I love learning, thinking and creating. Currently exploring modern web tech and emerging computing paradigms.
